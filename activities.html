        <h3>Cartagena</h3> <!-- third headers specify the names of locations -->
        <p>Known as the ‘Jewel of the Caribbean’, Cartagena is almost too beautiful for words. Year-round sunny skies, clear Caribbean waters, colorful colonial architecture and a wealth of Afro-Colombian culture to explore. A vast of cobblestone laneways that weave between pastel-painted walls, plants that flow across balcony alcoves and a ocean that sparkles in the horizon. The whole thing feels like wandering through a romantic film-set.
           <br>~ Available to all ages</br><!-- break tags -->

        <h3>La Zona Cafetera</h3>
        <p>Aslo known as 'the Coffee Triangle', this region has a booming coffee production business and the verdant hill country in which the crop is produced is exceptionally scenic. Manizales, Salento and Armenia are the principal production towns. Aside from being scenic towns in their own rights, the surrounding rolling hills and gullies, coated in lush greenery year-round, make for a very attractive backdrop as if it were from a Windows home screen.

        <h3>Villa de Leyva</h3>
        <p>Almost every place in Colombia has scenic greenery, but the colonial white-washed town feels like stepping into the past. Built by soldiers who had come to conquer the New World, they had to go big or go home. As a result, they were left with luscious green backdrops, chalk white buildings, with no modern architecture in sight. Considered one of the most impressive and finest towns in all of South America
